## About me
I’m a Full Stack Developer & Technology Leader with over a decade of experience building performant, scalable, and user-focused web platforms — from eCommerce and SaaS applications to marketing sites and automation tools.

Currently serving as Director of Technology at Altos, I lead web infrastructure strategy, mentor development teams, and collaborate cross-functionally with marketing and operations to drive digital success. My toolbox includes PHP, JavaScript (Vue, React, TypeScript), Laravel, Node.js, Python, Docker, HubSpot, and CMS platforms like WordPress and Webflow.
